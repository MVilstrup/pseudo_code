This repository is meant to include all the algorithms and mathematical formulas and explanations I stumble upon in my day to day life. 

It is saved in a format suitable for the electronic frame: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001FBXM6C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0, which is why each concept/algorithm is on its own page.
