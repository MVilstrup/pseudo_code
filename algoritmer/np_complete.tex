\centerline{A problem is \textbf{NP-complete} if it can only be solved by algorithms that run in \textit{exponential} time.} 
\centerline{No \textit{polynomial} time algorithms are known to exist for any \textbf{NP-complete} problems}
\centerline{It is very unlikely that \textit{polynomial} time algorithms should indeed exists.}
\centerline{No one have been able to disprove the possibility that \textit{polynomial} time algorithms could exists}
